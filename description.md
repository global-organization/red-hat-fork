Goal of this repository is to create framework of the work process in about to be acquired Red Hat.  
I know it has been quite an open atmosphere where people shared responsibility choosen their tools, communicated and much more.  
Red Had was always open to shere their work and not to be greedy to expose it and make money on support.  
That always been in genes of the company, so let's try to create the fork in case things will go bad.
